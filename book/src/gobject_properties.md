# Properties

Properties allow us to access state of GObjects.

Let us see how this is done by experimenting with the `Switch` widget.
One of its properties is the [state](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/property.Switch.state.html).
It can be read and be written to.
We do that by calling the `get_property` and `set_property` methods.
Since all of this is highly dynamic, checks occur at runtime and the code involves a bit of boilerplate.

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust ,no_run
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/gobject_properties_1/src/main.rs:switch}}
```

Properties can also be bound to each other.
Let us see how would bind the properties of two `Switch` instances.

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust ,no_run
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/gobject_properties_2/src/main.rs:switches}}
```

In our case, we want to bind the "state" property of `switch_1` to the "state" property of `switch_2`.
We also want the binding to be bidirectional, so we specify this with the [`BindingFlags`](http://gtk-rs.org/docs/glib/struct.BindingFlags.html).

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust ,no_run
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/gobject_properties_2/src/main.rs:bind_state}}
```

Whenever we now click on one of the two switches, the other one gets toggled as well.

We can also add properties to custom GObjects.
We can demonstrate that, by binding the `number` of our `CustomButton` to a property.

However, we first need to add `once_cell` to our dependencies.
With this, we can [lazily evaluate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) expressions, which we often need when working with custom GObjects.

```toml
[dependencies]
once_cell = "1"
```

Then we have to define the property within the `ObjectImpl` implementation.

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust ,no_run
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/gobject_properties_3/src/main.rs:object_impl}}
```

The `properties` method describes our set of properties.
When naming our property, we make sure to do that in [kebab-case](https://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase).
Then, we describe its type, range and default value.
We also declare that the property can be read and be written to.
`set_property` describes how the underlying values can be changed.
`get_property` takes care of returning the underlying value.
The formerly private `number` is now accessible via the `get_property` and `set_property` methods.

Let us see what we can do with this by creating two custom buttons.

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust ,no_run
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/gobject_properties_3/src/main.rs:buttons}}
```

The numbers of the two buttons can now be bound to each other.

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust ,no_run
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/gobject_properties_3/src/main.rs:bind_number}}
```

The numbers are bound to each other, but if we now press on one button, the label of the other one does not get updated.
Luckily, "label" is a built-in property of `Button`, the class from which `CustomButton` inherits of.
All we have to do is to bind the "label" property of `button_1` to the "label" property of `button_2`.

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust ,no_run
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/gobject_properties_3/src/main.rs:bind_label}}
```

If we now click on one button, the "number" and "label" properties of the other button change as well.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="img/gobject_properties_buttons.png"/></div>

The final nice feature of properties is, that you can connect a callback to the event when a property gets changed.
We can do this like this:

```rust ,no_run
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/gobject_properties_3/src/main.rs:connect_notify}}
```

Now, whenever the "number" property gets changed, the closure gets executed and prints the current value of "number".

You will want to introduce properties to your custom GObjects whenever you want
- to allow consumers to be able to access internal state,
- to bind state of (different) GObjects or
- to notify consumers whenever the property gets set.
